# Advent of Code 2025

Hi welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository.
This year I try to solve the puzzles using rust.


## Usage

Build the project using cargo:
```bash
cargo build
```

Execute the project:
```bash
cargo run <day>
```

Where `<day>` is the puzzle you want to execute. If no day is given the last solved day will be executed.


## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual December programming challenge that delivers a small algorithmic puzzle each day from December 1-25.
